E.g. For a project with 2 years of data acquisition, collecting a total of 1TB and 1 million files, the request form could look like this:

{{< card header="Description of the project">}}
...
{{< /card >}}
{{< card header="Extra storage required">}}
Increase storage space by 1TB.<br>
Increase file count limit by 1M files.<br>
<br>
Collection is connected to UQ XNAT so cannot zip/tar files

{{< /card >}}
{{< card header="Estimated growth rate">}}
0.5TB per year<br>
0.5M files per year<br>
{{< /card >}}
{{< card header="Rapid access requirements">}}
