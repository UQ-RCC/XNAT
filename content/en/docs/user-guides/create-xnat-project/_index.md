  Create XNAT project
---

<!-- ## Pre-requisite
To create an XNAT project, you’ll need a **QRIScloud Q-collection**. These are
1. QRIScloud collections that end in Q**** (e.g. Q0189)
2. UQ-RDM collections that end in Q**** (e.g. PROJ001-Q0189)

If you have either, you can use the existing collection, and skip to the next section.

If you have a UQ-RDM collection that end in A**** or I**** (e.g. PROJ001-A0189, PROJ001-I0189), you will need to create a UQ-RDM Q-collection

[Non-UQ Users](/docs/user-guides/create-xnat-project/create-q-collection-non-uq-users)

## Creating an XNAT Project

Open a ticket with QRIScloud support (support@qriscloud.org.au) 
- Ask them to make your Q-collection available to XNAT
- Quote the collection number in the email
 
The support ticket will inform you when the project is set up.
- An XNAT project will be created with the matching Q**** name.
- An “xnat” directory will be created in the Q**** collection for storing the XNAT data files.
- Please do not write or modify anything under the “xnat” directory. -->
