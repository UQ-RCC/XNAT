This is for users from non-AAF member organisations, including:
  - QLD Health, TRI, QIMR, QLD Xray

Non-AAF members usually require XNAT access for: 
- Management of data acquisition from sites such as CAI, HIRF, TRI
- Collaborating on projects managed on UQ-RCC XNAT

XNAT uses AAF for login. QCIF/QRIScloud can provide AAF Virtual Home (VHO) accounts for non-AAF users.

## Creating an AAF VHO account

#### Step 1
Open a ticket with RCC support to request an AAF account

_Example below (replace __________ with your details)_

{{< card header="**To:** rcc-support@uq.edu.au" subtitle="**Subject:** XNAT AAF account for project __________" >}}
Hello RCC support

I require an AAF account to access the UQ AIS XNAT service<br>

My details are below<br>
Organisation: __________<br>
Data Acquisition Site: __________<br>
{{< /card >}}

#### Step 2
AAF's VHO account will return an email regarding the VHO account registration process

#### Step 3
_After account is provisioned, continue on to the [Other AAF members guide](/docs/user-guides/getting-started/other-aaf-members)_
