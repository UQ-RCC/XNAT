This is for users from non-AAF member organisations, including:
  - QLD Health, TRI, QIMR, QLD Xray

Non-AAF members usually require XNAT access for: 
- Management of data acquisition from sites such as CAI, HIRF, TRI
- Collaborating on projects managed on UQ-RCC XNAT

XNAT uses AAF for login. QCIF/QRIScloud can provide AAF Virtual Home (VHO) accounts for non-AAF users.
