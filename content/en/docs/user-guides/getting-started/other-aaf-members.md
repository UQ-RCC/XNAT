- QUT, Griffith, CQU, JCU, USQ, USC

- Management of data acquisition from sites such as CAI, HIRF, TRI
- Collaborating on projects managed on UQ AIS XNAT

Full list of AAF members found [here](https://aaf.edu.au/subscribers)<br>
For all other organisations, use the [Non-AAF members](/docs/user-guides/getting-started/non-aaf-members) guide
