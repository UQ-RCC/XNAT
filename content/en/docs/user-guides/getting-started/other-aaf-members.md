This guide is for users from Australian Universities and AAF member organisations, including:
- QUT, Griffith, CQU, JCU, USQ, USC
- CSIRO, Australian Universities
- AAF VHO accounts

Other AAF members usually require UQ AIS XNAT access for: 
- Management of data acquisition from sites such as CAI, HIRF, TRI
- Collaborating on projects managed on UQ AIS XNAT

Full list of AAF members found [here](https://aaf.edu.au/subscribers)<br>
For all other organisations, use the [Non-AAF members](/docs/user-guides/getting-started/non-aaf-members) guide

## Signing into XNAT

#### Step 1
Open [https://xnat.rcc.uq.edu.au](https://xnat.rcc.uq.edu.au)
{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
This is the link to the UQ AIS XNAT. If you have been provided with a project specific XNAT link to use, use that one instead
{{% /alert %}}

#### Step 2
Login in with the AAF Single sign-on button (_See below_).

If the error remains after multiple refreshes, contact support.

#### Step 3

After the AAF sign-in, you should be redirected back to XNAT (_Example below_)

There will be **no projects listed** when signing in for the first-time, as your user account would have just been created.
