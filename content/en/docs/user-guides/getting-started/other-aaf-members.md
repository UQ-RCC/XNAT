If you cannot find your organisation in the AAF list, try the instructions for [non-aaf-members](../non-aaf-members)

After the AAF sign-in, you should be redirected back to XNAT (Example below)

There will be **no projects listed** when signing in for the first-time, as your user account would have just been created.
