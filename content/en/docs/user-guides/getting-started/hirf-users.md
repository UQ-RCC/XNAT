## Creating an XNAT Project
---
1. Open a ticket with QRIScloud support (Example below)

   {{< card header="To: support@qriscloud.org.au" subtitle="Subject: XNAT project **PROJ001-Q0189**">}}
   Please create an XNAT project for RDM collection **PROJ001-Q0189**
   {{< /card >}}

2. The support ticket will inform you when the project is set up.
   - An XNAT project will be created with the matching **PROJXXX-QXXXX** name.
   - An **xnat** directory will be created in the RDM collection for storing the XNAT data files.
   - Please do not write or modify anything under the **xnat** directory.

XNAT Project setup typically takes around ~24 hours from ticket submission.
An automated email from XNAT will be sent through when project is ready, and your user has been added
