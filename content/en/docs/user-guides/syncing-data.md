  Syncing data to other XNAT Projects
---

The UQ-RCC XNAT may be able to sync datasets to other XNATs in Australia. 

To see if your project is able to be synced, send a ticket to QRIScloud support (support@qriscloud.org.au)

They will need the details of the XNAT that you wish to share data with.
